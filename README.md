A Python program that computes the **sum of the logarithms of all prime numbers** from `2` up to a given number `n`, and prints:  

- The sum of the logs of the primes  
- The number `n`  
- The ratio of these two quantities  

According to the **Prime Number Theorem**, this ratio approaches `1` as `n` increases (though not monotonically).  

---

##  Features
-  Efficient prime checking function (`is_prime`).  
-  Calculates the **sum of logarithms of primes** up to any integer `n`.  
-  Demonstrates the **Prime Number Theorem** in action.  
-  Prints results for multiple values of `n`.

##  Usage
Run the script directly:

```bash
python prime_logs.py
